<h2>Magdoran Conglomerate</h2><br>
As populous as they are varied, the <f>Magdoran Conglomerate</f> is one of the more prominent members of the interstellar community- albeit quite young, even compared to their nation states.<br>
Magdoran history and culture still bears the marks of an alien race arriving on their homeworld, attempting to "uplift" the Magdorans... and being removed some years later. In the millenia since, the Magdoran people were cautious about contact with other aliens, but the near-century of peace and cooperation with their interstellar neighbours has largely nullified their hesitancy.<br>
That still leaves their "curiousity"- a near incessant need to hunt down and study the relics of the aliens that invaded their world, to study and repurpose their technology, and if they can manage it... find out why they vanished shortly after leaving <f>Magdora</f>.<br>
<br>
The Magdoran species is, like their interstellar empire, a sum of many- albeit in the physiological sense as well as every other. Seven in total, each of the Magdoran races are tailed (and in one case winged!) bipeds, largely able to be associated with a taxonomic class of animal, including, two classes of mammal, avians, reptiles- and even the much rarer aquatic mammals and insectoids. With such a variety even just on their own worlds, it has been noticeably easier for non-Magdoran races to integrate themselves into Magdoran society when compared to their contemporaries.<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, a good portion of Magdoran high-end technology is based on that of the Titans, the aliens that temporarily occupied their world- and further still, it makes heavy use of the mysterious substance known as <fuc>Ucrylium</fuc>.<br>
Advanced computers, magnetic weapons, gravity shields, even the Gates they have come to rely on for interstellar travel- While many applications were still of their own make, much of Magdoran technology is in truth far older than they are.<br>
<br>
While the Magdoran navy nonetheless exists for the protection of Magdora and its people, as well as the enforcement of its laws, Magdoran-built ships are typically far more utilitarian than their equivalents, opting for multi-specialisation rather than hyper-specialisation. Carriers as support ships, science vessels as electronic warfare vessels, colony ships as transports- as long as it can fit in the one ship, it can probably do it.
