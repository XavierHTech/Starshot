Something to fit the mood...

As I return to working on <ss>Starshot</ss> in a more complete capacity, one area I have decided to immediately focus on was my UI- namely, giving it a complete pass for all assets and the general layout. I may get in touch with a more artistically capable friend in future to clean up and improve assets some time in the future- but I'm content with what I've done so far, even just for demonstration.

If you've seen this website's banner- Well, you've already seen the broad theme I'm going for. "Angular minimalist" I want to call it, even with that probably very wrong. But, in text form: Overall minimalist design, a single background shade with a contrasting foreground shade, with the foreground itself generally consisting of a thin border and a small number of thick stripes with sharp edges and angles, used to draw focus towards the content of the element.

This is how the story layer looks currently- and of course, this is still subject to change, particularly as I move into making the strategy layer's UI.

Now, if you were two notice any two things in particular, I'm willing to bet it's the "Gamma" and "[[ N/A ]]"
 buttons- the second especially. In short, the gamma button is recoloured to represent that it has an 
immediate reward- using a placeholder icon to show what kind of reward exactly, while the N/A button exists 
to show the player that there are <f>unnaccessible choices</f> for this text block. It is not there to show what those options are, only that some cannot be selected for one reason or another.

The N/A button is special on its own- it uses a particular material affect to make it appear as if the button is glitching (though this could be vastly improved), but both of them make use of one other thing I have been experimenting with: Colour masking.

Essentially, every UI background image (More components are likely to be added at some stage) can be recoloured on the fly with the help of a standardised function library, allowing any UI element making use of it to set elements to any colour that is desired.

Though I haven't come anywhere near implementing it just yet, the hope with this is to eventually allow the players to completely customise the colours used by the UI- But for the time being, I'm using it to reduce the amount of assets and have more flexibility with my colour schemes.
