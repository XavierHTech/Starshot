And we are live!

This post marks the launch of the <ss>Starshot</ss> blog! Through this blog I intend to speak about the project much in the same way I have previously, but with much more flexibility regarding the length and content of the posts. Of course, I will try to announce when a post goes up via linkedin and twitter, but be sure to check back regularly to see what I've done!

I still have plenty to do with the blog and site itself though- namely, pagination- but as it stands everything functions as intended, and hopefully I will get back into full-swing development in short order.
