Small and un-fun post. Not the kick I need to resume working proper, but it's the one I'm giving myself.

Long story short: Life has not been particularly fun for me since my last update. If you really want details you can ask, but I want to make that much clear.

The myriad of issues both minor and large have drastically sapped me of my want to continue working on this project and others, and in spite of the flooding that has been affecting my area, it is only just starting to come back now. Unfortunately for Starshot, it is right now being focused on two less-serious private projects, but I haven't forgotten about it yet. I have plans for it still, I only need to enact them when I have the energy.

That's all. Try to have a good day/month/year, and remember that I'm always open to talk. Probably.
