  In a time best compared to our distant future, life and civilisation flourish between the stars.<br>
  Numerous races and empires spread themselves as far as they can reach, and thankfully many have found peace with each other- with a number more joining with the <f>Magdoran Conglomerate</f>.<br><br>
  But despite this peace and expansionism, many sectors remain unclaimed, and uncontrolled. The lawless <f>Grey Zones</f> are havens for piracy, treachery, and great hidden riches.<br>
  Claims and order there are founded on strength and barter- and even the strongest havens are a target for someone.<br><br>

  <section id="Factions">
  <br><br>
  Everyone is part of a group, even one defined by their solitude. No matter how large or small the faction, their duty is to uphold their values, utilising whatever strengths they have- or weaknesses held by others.<br><br>
  
  <section id="FMagd">
  <h2>Magdoran Conglomerate</h2><br>
  The most prominent living faction, the <f>Magdoran Conglomerate</f> is the most overall advanced, and the most rapid expansionists in their region of space.<br>
  First to truly understand the mysterious and powerful <fuc>Ucrylium</fuc>, the <f>Conglomerate</f> was the first to utilise true faster-than-light technology, in the form of their <fuc>Gate</fuc> systems.<br>
  But they did not discover it themselves...<br><br>
  Though the modern <f>Conglomerate</f> is itself a union of the planets that would willingly hold themselves to its charter, the <f>Magdorans</f> themselves consist of multiple sapient races- evolving simultaneously on the super-Earth homeworld they are named for.
  <br><br>
  
  <section id="FE">
  <h2>Imperium of Nitav</h2><br>
  The closest neighbours of the <f>Conglomerate</f>, and religous seekers of the <f>Titans</f>.<br>
  Reptilians with an unlikely start on a tidally-locked karst world, the <f>Imperium</f> seeks to assert themselves as the true heirs to the power of the <f>Titans</f>.<br>
  Unlike many of the races encountered by the <f>Conglomerate</f> in the early stages of interstellar expansion, the <f>Imperium</f> had completely dominated their home system before the <f>Magdoran's</f> arrival, having developed an effective form of near-FTL travel, alongside constructing fleets far more capable than anything <f>Magdora</f> could produce at the time.<br>
  It was only fortunate that the two would not be pushed into war.
  <br><br>
  
  <section id="FLiiy">
  <h2>Liiya Directorate</h2><br>
  Physically unusual, but driven seekers of all forms of knowledge, the beings known as the <f>Liiya</f> are among the sector's brightest and most pacifistic.<br>
  Equally known for having the form of a literal jellyfish, and for housing themselves in a variety of robotic bodies, all <f>Liiya</f> have a driven need to learn and explore- be that in the physical sense, or the social.<br>
  They are often considered invaluable on any ship, but the more solitary members of their race often are so with good- if not always understandable- reason.
  <br><br>
  
  <section id="FTarr">
  <h2>Tarridian Military Command</h2><br>
  Bred for war in a rather literal sense, the <f>Tarridan</f> are insectoids whose culture and physiology are best suited for combating threats as directly as possible, though they were abandoned by their original creators milennia ago.<br>
  Thankfully for most, they have long since abandoned any uncontrollable aggression, and now try to live a more civilised life- but their drive and skill will always be present, and they are always ready.
  <br><br>
  
  <section id="FPira">
  <h2>Pirate Clans</h2><br>
  Long ago, thousands of years before they even dreamed of being an interstellar empire, the primitive species of <f>Magdora</f> were visited by a race now known as the <f>Titans</f>, ancient and now extinct aliens who were even further beyond the capabilities of the <f>Conglomerate</f>, and left a myriad of artefacts on <f>Magdora</f> and other worlds.<br>
  Though legends tell of fighting back against the invaders, after being taught a good deal about themselves and the world around them, it is unknown where they went after <f>Magdora</f>, or why they left so much behind.

  <h2>The Titans</h2><br>
  Long ago, thousands of years before they even dreamed of being an interstellar empire, the primitive species of <f>Magdora</f> were visited by a race now known as the <f>Titans</f>, ancient and now extinct aliens who were even further beyond the capabilities of the <f>Conglomerate</f>, and left a myriad of artefacts on <f>Magdora</f> and other worlds.<br>
  Though legends tell of fighting back against the invaders, after being taught a good deal about themselves and the world around them, it is unknown where they went after <f>Magdora</f>, or why they left so much behind.
  <br><br>
  
  
  </div><div id="Technology" class="tabcontent">
  <section id="Technology">
  <br><br>
  The lifeblood of advanced civilisations is technology, and that which fuels their technology. The races of the <f>Titanborne's Roost</f> are no different, but while other races and periods would base their technology on nuclear energy, coal, or even oil- these races base theirs on the volatile and mysterious <fuc>Ucrylium</fuc>.<br><br>
  
  <h2>Ucrylium</h2><br>
  A mysterious element, often believed to not be natural to this reality, <fuc>Ucrylium</fuc> is equally volatile, corrosive, and toxic, and also- in the right hands- capable of performing feats almost magical in nature, from ripping holes into and bridges through <fuc>a parallel reality</fuc>, to serving as fuel for <fuc>exotic matter accelerators</fuc>, or even the creation of <fuc>incredibly precise circuitry</fuc>.<br>
  Finding exploitable deposits of <fuc>Ucrylium</fuc> is rare, but an individual who does find one- especially if they can then extract and even refine it, would be rich beyond their wildest dreams.<br>
  Or so popular culture would say.
  <br><br>
  
  <h2>Gates</h2><br>
  The basis for <f>Magdoran</f> interstellar travel, as well as anyone else granted access to the technology, <fuc>Gates and Gate-Drives</fuc> create bridges to distant locations- or translocate the user to said location, respectively- by utilising a parallel dimension known officially as <fuc>U-Space</fuc>.<br>
  Without access to a <fuc>Gate-Drive</fuc>, or access to the greater <fuc>Gate Network</fuc>, one would have to rely on slower <fuc>Slip-Drives</fuc>, but movement between even closely neighbouring stars could take months, or even years, with these.<br>
  Despite the power of <fuc>Gates</fuc>, <fuc>U-Space</fuc> is a turbulent and chaotic space- with travel time and accuracy varying wildly, with symptoms such as these progressively worsening as jump range increases. Especially outside of the <fuc>Gate Network</fuc>, this makes jumps over more than a couple dozen lightyears inadvisable. 
  <br><br>
  
  <h2>Starships and Starbases</h2><br>
  Though individual manufacturers maintain and implement their own flairs, the designs of stellar structures and vessels remain largely uniform in terms of desirable traits and equipment, depending on their desired usage.<br>
  Everything from the smallest parasite craft to the near-mythical dreadnaughts are carefully designed for the niche they occupy, often with enough flexibility to save them from a future of redundancy. To this end, even the smallest long-range frigates are capable of self-retrofitting, provided they have the right materials on hand.<br><br>
  
</div><div id="Other" class="tabcontent">
  <section id="Other">
  <br><br>
  <h2>Other</h2><br>
  <h3>Modding</h3><br>
  Though implementing such is foreign territory for Xavier, modding is intended to be a large aspect of the game's lifespan. Ex datatables as its "primary" datatables, so adding new tables would itself be reasonably simple.<br>
  Primarily, modding support will require either a dedicated mod manager tool or built-in plugins, both as a result of how Unreal Engine 4 handles mods. Despite this, a number of key game elements- namely, ships and story and choice data- are already fairly capable of supporting modding, provided a means of integrating new datatables is implemented.<br>
  <h3>Progression</h3><br>
  Metagame progression is a staple of the roguelike genre, and <ss>Starshot</ss> is not an exception to this. By completing runs, the player will be able to access new official content if they complete certain objectives.<br>
  One such piece of content is an entirely unique fleet set and storyline, that will be hidden among other official content.<br>
