Extra details on something I'm about to work on

Though I am currently waist-deep in a proper pass of <ss>Starshot</ss>'s UI, the next task will be a much broader refinement pass at the story layer- revamping ad-hoc functionality, adding new features, and generally bringing it closer to the final vision.

I've written this post in preparation for it, as these will be some of the areas I'm improving on with my refinement pass.

<h2>So, how do ships work in the story layer?</h2>
Primarily, ships behave as if they were any other item- an incredibly valuable and often irreplaceable item, but an item nonetheless- being rewarded, bought, exchanged and used in the choices a player is given. Ship related choices could require anything from a specific number of ships or a ship of a specific class, to ships loaded with certain modules, or in some very specific scenarios, potentially even a particular model of ship.

Regardless of whether they're used in a decision, the time used in the story layer is used to repair and maintain ships, and random incidents may occur on parts of your fleet as well, with varying effects. Said incidents would appear and be reacted to in the same way the player would respond to other story segments.

<h2>Inventory and Equipment</h2>
With the aforementioned downtime comes the opportunity to refit ships as well, switching modules between the fleet and the generic inventory. The inventory system will likely be tied to a store mechanic as well at some stage, but one thing at a time. Namely- the inventory itself still has some details to iron out before it can be implemented in the first place.

At present, the idea behind the inventory is that each ship features space for its own loadout- including dedicated slots for basic equipment- while there also exists a generic inventory for items not specifically equipped on a ship. One thing I have been considering with it is whether and how ships could impact the generic inventory, namely if its maximum capacity should be increased by the ships in the players fleet without it being a special circumstance.

<h2>Obtaining new ships</h2>
In short? It depends.

If shops and trading get added, they will likely become the greatest source of common ship models- however, story events will be the best passive source regardless. Though the exact balance will need testing, and will be highly dependent on the story threads written, rarer, more costly, and main story choices will be the focus on sources of powerful ships to add to the player's fleet.
