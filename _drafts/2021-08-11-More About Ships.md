What makes ships tick- in even greater detail, with examples.

Though I am presently working on a broad and fairly experimental pass of all of <ss>Starshot</ss>'s UI- as well as planning revamps and additions to the story system, I have decided to make this post to provide even more detail on how I intend for ships to work in the story layer, as well as detail some unmentioned features.

<h2>So, how do ships work in the story layer?</h2>
Primarily, ships behave as if they were any other item- an incredibly valuable and often irreplaceable item, but an item nonetheless- being rewarded, bought, exchanged and used in the choices a player is given. Ship related choices could require anything from a specific number of ships or a ship of a specific class, to ships loaded with certain modules, or in some very specific scenarios, potentially even a particular model of ship.

Regardless of whether they're used in a decision, the time used in the story layer is used to repair and maintain ships, and random incidents may occur on parts of your fleet as well, with varying effects. Said incidents would appear and be reacted to in the same way the player would respond to other story segments.

<h2>Inventory and Equipment</h2>
With the aforementioned downtime comes the opportunity to refit ships as well, switching modules between the fleet and the generic inventory. The inventory system will likely be tied to a store mechanic as well at some stage, but one thing at a time. Namely- the inventory itself still has some details to iron out before it can be implemented in the first place.

At present, the idea behind the inventory is that each ship features space for its own loadout- including dedicated slots for basic equipment- while there also exists a generic inventory for items not specifically equipped on a ship. One thing I have been considering with it is whether and how ships could impact the generic inventory, namely if its maximum capacity should be increased by the ships in the players fleet without it being a special circumstance.

<h2>Obtaining new ships</h2>
In short? It depends.

If shops and trading get added, they will likely become the greatest source of common ship models- however, story events will be the best passive source regardless. Though the exact balance will need testing, and will be highly dependent on the story threads written, rarer, more costly, and main story choices will be the focus on sources of powerful ships to add to the player's fleet.

As already explained in the strategy section of <a href="https://xavierhtech.github.io/Starshot/game.html">the game glossary,</a> ships are primarily identified by two features: Their specialisation, and hull class. I will talk about hull classes first, as they are the most straightforward of the two.

<h2>Hull Classes</h2>
As previously explained, hulls can be placed into three broad categories (in regards to ones the player can use, at any rate), those being <f>frigates, cruisers, and parasite craft</f>. I will elaborate more on parasite craft when I talk about carriers, so let's focus on the other two; frigates and cruisers.

Generally, the trade-off between these two is speed and maneuverability or size and durability, with "sub-classes" like the <f>corvette</f> further refining this tradeoff, while still being categorised as a frigate in this instance. One thing to bear in mind with sub-classes, however, is that they are largely ignorable when it comes to at-a-glance information; Subclasses will share the symbology and general profile of their parent class, but will still have an impact on the performance of a ship.

As for modules and equipment, there is still a trade-off, but primarily when it comes to amount. Most modules will fit ships regardless of their hull class, and the same will go for weapons and shields. Whether they will be as effective will be a matter of how they're used- shotgun-like cannons could equally be used in hit-and-run tactics, and on ships that can take a beating at point-blank, as an example.

In the story layer of the game, ships largely behave as any other resource would- you can obtain them from completing certain arcs, objectives, and so on, and they can be exchanged to complete other objectives and arcs, albeit at a much greater risk because of their value. This can be anything from scouting an asteroid field with a frigate, to loaning cruisers to deal with pirates, or even receiving civilian ships for you to escort elsewhere. Broadly, events like these would be on the powerful end- even just in the sense of unlocking unique arcs and storylines,- but would generally come at some degree of risk, particularly if it involves an actual transfer.

Because of this, I fully expect players to build fleets for particular interactions- frigates to maximise on interactions that require speed and finesse, cruisers to maximise on the ability to flex strength, and with specialisations adding to the mix to make particular ships more or less valuable.


<h2>Specialisations</h2>
... Or in other words, classes. Specialisations determine the intended behaviour for a ship, as well as what ability modules (and other specialist equipment) can be mounted on them. As with hull classes, there is a use for these in both layers of <ss>Starshot</ss>, though unlike hull classes a specialist requirement may require a particular module type be installed on the appropriate ship.

A more complete roster will feature in a later post, but for now I will focus on three: The <f>Battleship, ECM and Carrier</f> specialisations.

<h3>Battleship</h3>
The most straightforward specialisation, <f>battleships</f> are your jack-of-all-trades combat ships, and equally defined by their lack of specialisation as their focus on main weaponry.

Aside from being a catch-all for unspecialised ships, battleships can have more main weapons than other ship classes, but lack access to many of the more powerful weapons and modules. In battle and outside of it, battleships are flexible, but often used as an impressive display of power to those who don't have anything specialised.

<h3>ECM</h3>
ECMs, or Electronic CounterMeasure ships, are one of your most basic buff and debuff-centred ship specialisations. Most specialisations like it have a more specific utility, but ECMs are very broadly designed to interfere with enemy offensive and defensive capabilities- weakening defensive bonuses from shields and point-defense, countering interference, or providing some of its own.

A well placed ECM ship could disable the heavier weapons of multiple cruisers, or screen allied cruisers against parasite craft and torpedos, and particularly advanced ECMs may even be able to hijack automated systems, or cause other forms of havoc!

<h3>Carrier</h3>
The last, and certainly not least of this demonstration- Carriers. Carriers are capable of performing a minor role in all things, and can do so from the safety of an extended range, provided their hangars can meet the demand.

Though it may be rather self-explanatory, carriers are specialists in using parasite craft- small fighters and bombers that are incapable of independent gate travel. Many of the larger ships may be capable of housing parasite craft, but carriers are the only ones that truly specialise in it, increasing the strength of the parasite craft it does deploy, and being able to use more kinds of parasite craft than other ships of their size.

As for the parasite craft themselves- They come in many forms, just like larger ships, but they are generally only capable of a limited number of things, depending on their type. For example, interceptor fighters could be used to intercept torpedos, or harass larger ships to weaken their defenses, while bombers can be deployed to deal crippling blows to ships without screening. <f>Rumors even tell about the existence of pirate scrapper bots...</f>
